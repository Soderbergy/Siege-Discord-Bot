# Roasts
ROASTS = [
    "You're the reason we need drone economy.",
    "I'd tell you to aim higher, but you might hit a teammate.",
    "You're like a stun grenade: everyone's annoyed when you show up.",
    "If potato aim was a competition, you'd still miss.",
    "You get more kills with your mic than your gun.",
    "I've seen drones with better movement.",
    "You're proof that spawnpeeking isn't for everyone.",
    "Are you trying to plant or just sightseeing?",
    "Your aim is so shaky, I thought you were on dial-up.",
    "You're a walking entry frag. For the other team.",
    "You must be running dial-up. Your aim’s always lagging behind.",
    "Your favorite operator must be the bench.",
    "If you were a gadget, you’d be a default cam—out in the open and ignored.",
    "You aim like you’re playing whack-a-mole at the arcade.",
    "Your callouts are like your aim—completely off.",
    "If confusion was a strat, you’d be the team captain.",
    "You could get spawnpeeked in T-Hunt.",
    "I’ve seen claymores with better placement.",
    "Your drone work is top tier—if only you played the rest of the game.",
    "Your best play was uninstalling the game.",
    "You reload after every shot, don’t you?",
    "Your utility usage is as empty as your scoreboard.",
    "The only thing you clear is your own team.",
    "You’re the human embodiment of a misthrown smoke.",
    "You’d lose a gunfight to a security camera.",
    "You’re not bottom fragging—you’re anchoring the team’s morale.",
    "When you queue up, the enemy team wins the lottery.",
    "At least your deaths give us time to check TikTok.",
    "You hear more footsteps in your head than in the game.",
    "Even Tachanka has higher stats.",
    "Your FOV is set to potato.",
    "I’d roast your stats, but it’d be bullying.",
    "You have ‘insert coin to continue’ energy.",
    "If you get banned for toxicity, it’ll be for your gameplay.",
    "Your best strat is accidental.",
    "Your bullets do less damage than harsh language.",
    "If you’re clutching, the enemy’s AFK.",
    "You miss so much, you’re banned from dodgeball.",
    "Callouts: 0, Deaths: 7, Vibes: Immaculate.",
    "You’re more lost than a drone in a Mozzie trap."
